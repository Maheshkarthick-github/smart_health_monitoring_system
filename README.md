**This project is an IoT-based smart health monitoring system designed to track and predict health risks using real-time sensor data. The system uses multiple sensors to measure heart rate, temperature, ECG signals, and air quality and visualizes the data through a Flask web application.**

Hardware Used
ESP32 — Microcontroller for sensor data handling and WiFi communication

MQ135 — Gas Sensor for air quality monitoring

Pulse Amped Sensor — For heart rate detection

DHT22 — For temperature and humidity readings

AD8232 — For ECG signal acquisition

Jumper wires, breadboard, power supply

Wireless Data Transmission using ESP32 (WiFi).

AI-Driven Health Risk Predictor to detect abnormalities such as heart attacks, dehydration, and unsafe air quality.

Flask Web Dashboard for real-time data visualization and alert notifications.

Scalable for future wearable or home-based health systems.
